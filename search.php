            Plans for this page:
            the goal of this page is to put in information about something, and be able to get the rest of the information about it.
            <br><br>Very simply, this page will provide a form for each kind of thing you can look up, and will direct you to "GET" pages that return tables of data.
            <br> using "GET" pages will mean that the URL can be copied and sent, and you can bookmark results and all that.
            <br><br> This will allow people to either get information they need, or get the ID of what they need to change.
